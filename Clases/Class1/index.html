                Ingredients: 4 medium potatoes (thinly sliced), 1 onion (thinly sliced), 6 eggs, salt, pepper, olive
                oil.
                Prep Potatoes: Heat olive oil in a non-stick skillet, add potatoes and onions. Cook on medium-low until
                tender
                (about 15 min).
                Whisk Eggs: In a bowl, whisk eggs and season with salt and pepper.
                Combine: Add the cooked potatoes and onions to the egg mixture. Let them soak for a few minutes.
                Heat Pan: Wipe the skillet and add a bit of olive oil. Heat on medium.
                Cook Mixture: Pour the egg-potato mixture into the skillet. Cook for 5-7 min, gently lifting edges to
                let
                uncooked egg flow underneath.
                Flip Tortilla: Place a plate over the skillet, carefully flip the tortilla onto the plate.
                Slide Back: Slide the tortilla back into the skillet and cook for another 5-7 min.
                Serve: Slide the cooked tortilla onto a plate. Let it cool slightly before slicing.
                Enjoy: Serve warm or at room temperature as a delicious potato tortilla. <br>
